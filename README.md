# iPhone Wallpapers based on the art of Helvetica Blanc

## Big Update! (Version 1.5)

I included 19 new wallpapers in this collection. I did some light editing in a few just to adjust them to the shape of a phone screen. Again, I used the same template I used previously leaving readable space for the clock at the top and widgets at the bottom. 

These are the new artwork included in the new wallpapers:

## Original Wallpaper Selection

This repository contains a few wallpapers based on the art of [Helvetica Blanc](https://helveticablanc.com/index.html). Check [their Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/helveticablanc)!

These are the artworks used to create the wallpapers on this repository:
[Work 2](https://helveticablanc.com/20220830-work-2.html), 
[Vessel 3](https://helveticablanc.com/20220412-vessel-3.html), 
[Liturgy](https://helveticablanc.com/20201111-liturgy.html), 
[Gate 4](https://helveticablanc.com/20211119-gate-4.html),

[Invitation 2](https://helveticablanc.com/20220614-invitation-2.html), 
[Loci](https://helveticablanc.com/20210917-loci.html), 
[Reliquary](https://helveticablanc.com/20220721-reliquary.html), 
[Abrogation](https://helveticablanc.com/20220106-abrogation.html)

These wallpapers were tested on an iPhone 14 Pro (1720px x 3728 px), but they should fit nicely more modern iPhones.

I have edited the images to fit your phone's screen, taking into consideration the widget area and the notifications on the bottom. Some might not be perfect, just open an [issue](https://github.com/aersoares81/helvetica_blanc_wallpapers/issues) if you notice something is off and I'll re-edit them.

This is an example to demonstrate how iOS 16 spaces widgets, etc, in your Lock Screen:
