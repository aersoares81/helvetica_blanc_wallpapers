# Helvetica Blanc - Unnoficial iPhone Wallpapers

This repository contains a few wallpapers (designed to fit iPhones) based on the art of [Helvetica Blanc](https://helveticablanc.com/index.html).

This is the list of the original work by Helvetica Blanc:
[Work 2](https://helveticablanc.com/20220830-work-2.html), 
[Vessel 3](https://helveticablanc.com/20220412-vessel-3.html), 
[Liturgy](https://helveticablanc.com/20201111-liturgy.html), 
[Gate 4](https://helveticablanc.com/20211119-gate-4.html), 
[Invocation 6](https://helveticablanc.com/20220331-invocation-6.html), 
[Invitation 2](https://helveticablanc.com/20220614-invitation-2.html), 
[Loci](https://helveticablanc.com/20210917-loci.html), 
[Reliquary](https://helveticablanc.com/20220721-reliquary.html), 
[Abrogation](https://helveticablanc.com/20220106-abrogation.html)

These wallpapers were tested on an iPhone 14 Pro (1720px x 3728 px), but they should fit nicely more modern iPhones.

An example showing how I chose to space the elements in the images:

I have edited the images to fit nicely on your phone's screen, taking into consideration the widget area and the notifications on the bottom. Some might not be perfect, just open an [issue](https://github.com/aersoares81/helvetica_blanc_wallpapers/issues) if you notice something is off and I'll re-edit them.
